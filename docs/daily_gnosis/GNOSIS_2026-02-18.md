### 🍮 [Universal entanglement-inspired correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15520v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-17T11:48:51Z 🌀

> Quantum correlations, crucial for the advantage and advancement of quantum science and technology, arise from the impossibility of expressing a quantum state as a tensor product over a given set of parties. In this work, a generalized notion of correlations via arbitrary products is formulated. Remarkably, as a universal property, the connection between such general products and tensor products is established, allowing one to relate generic non-product states to the common notion of entangled st...

### 🍮 [GKP-inspired high-dimensional superdense coding with energy-time entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15125v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-16T19:01:59Z 🌀

> Superdense coding, the application of entanglement to boost classical communication capacity, is a cornerstone of quantum communication. In this paper, we propose a high-dimensional superdense coding protocol using energy-time entangled states. These states are biphoton frequency combs, an example of entangled time-frequency Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (TFGKP) states or time-frequency grid states. Inspired by GKP codes, our protocol involves discretizing the continuous time and frequency degrees o...

### 🍮 [Exact Multi-Valley Envelope Function Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Nanostructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14787v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-16T14:36:48Z 🌀

> Valley splitting in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells is a central parameter for silicon spin qubits and is commonly described with envelope-function and effective-mass theories. These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the...
