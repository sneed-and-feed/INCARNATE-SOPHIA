### 🍮 [Multi-emitter oscillating bound states in Waveguide QED](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16032v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-17T21:37:22Z 🌀

> Waveguide quantum electrodynamics platforms have emerged as promising candidates for exploring and implementing non-Markovian quantum phenomena. In this work, we investigate the formation and dynamics of superpositions of bound states in a cavity array waveguide coupled to two spatially separated quantum emitters. By tuning the system parameters, we show that spontaneous emission can drive the system into non-local equilibrium states in which both photonic and emitter populations exhibit persist...

### 🍮 [Universal entanglement-inspired correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15520v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-17T11:48:51Z 🌀

> Quantum correlations, crucial for the advantage and advancement of quantum science and technology, arise from the impossibility of expressing a quantum state as a tensor product over a given set of parties. In this work, a generalized notion of correlations via arbitrary products is formulated. Remarkably, as a universal property, the connection between such general products and tensor products is established, allowing one to relate generic non-product states to the common notion of entangled st...
