### 🍮 [Strategy optimization for Bayesian quantum parameter estimation with finite copies: Adaptive greedy, parallel, sequential, and general strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09655v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-10T11:05:45Z 🌀

> In this work, we study Bayesian quantum parameter estimation given a finite number of uses of the process encoding one or more unknown physical quantities. For multiple uses, it is conventional to classify quantum metrological protocols as parallel, sequential, or indefinite causal order. Within each class, the central question is to determine the optimal strategy -- namely, the choice of optimal input state, control operations, measurement, and estimator(s) -- to perform the estimation task. Us...

### 🍮 [A cavity-mediated reconfigurable coupling scheme for superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08869v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-09T16:30:30Z 🌀

> Superconducting qubits have achieved remarkable progress in gate fidelity and coherence, yet their typical nearest-neighbor connectivity presents constraints for implementing complex quantum circuits. Here, we introduce a cavity-mediated coupling architecture in which a shared cavity mode, accessed through tunable qubit-cavity couplers, enables dynamically reconfigurable interactions between non-adjacent qubits. By selectively activating the couplers, we demonstrate that high-fidelity iSWAP and ...

### 🍮 [Efficient circuit compression by multi-qudit entangling gates in linear optical quantum computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08394v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-09T08:52:41Z 🌀

> Linear optical quantum computation (LOQC) offers a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, but its scalability is fundamentally constrained by the probabilistic nature of non-local entangling gates. Qudit circuit compression schemes mitigate this issue by encoding multiple qubits onto qudits. However, these schemes become inefficient when only a subset of the encoded qubits is required to participate in the non-local entangling gate, leading to an exponential increase in ...
