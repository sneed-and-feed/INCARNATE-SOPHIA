### 🍮 [A cavity-mediated reconfigurable coupling scheme for superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08869v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-09T16:30:30Z 🌀

> Superconducting qubits have achieved remarkable progress in gate fidelity and coherence, yet their typical nearest-neighbor connectivity presents constraints for implementing complex quantum circuits. Here, we introduce a cavity-mediated coupling architecture in which a shared cavity mode, accessed through tunable qubit-cavity couplers, enables dynamically reconfigurable interactions between non-adjacent qubits. By selectively activating the couplers, we demonstrate that high-fidelity iSWAP and ...

### 🍮 [Efficient circuit compression by multi-qudit entangling gates in linear optical quantum computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08394v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-09T08:52:41Z 🌀

> Linear optical quantum computation (LOQC) offers a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, but its scalability is fundamentally constrained by the probabilistic nature of non-local entangling gates. Qudit circuit compression schemes mitigate this issue by encoding multiple qubits onto qudits. However, these schemes become inefficient when only a subset of the encoded qubits is required to participate in the non-local entangling gate, leading to an exponential increase in ...
