### 🍮 [Exact Multi-Valley Envelope Function Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Nanostructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14787v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-16T14:36:48Z 🌀

> Valley splitting in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells is a central parameter for silicon spin qubits and is commonly described with envelope-function and effective-mass theories. These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the...
