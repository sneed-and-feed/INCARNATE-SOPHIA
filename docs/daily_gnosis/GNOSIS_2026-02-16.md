### 🍮 [A Framework for Spatial Quantum Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12193v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-12T17:24:51Z 🌀

> Analytical and algebraic geometry are valuable tools for dealing with problems involving analytical functions and polynomials. In what we connote as spatial quantum sensing the goal is, given an underlying field and a set of quantum sensors interrogating the field in a set of positions, to find an estimator for some property the field. This property can have multiple forms, be it distinguishing the source of a target signal, or evaluating the field (or a derivative thereof) in an arbitrary posit...
