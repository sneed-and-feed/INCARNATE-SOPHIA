### 🍮 [Distributed Hyperbolic Floquet Codes under Depolarizing and Erasure Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17969v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-20T03:55:23Z 🌀

> Distributing qubits across quantum processing units (QPUs) connected by shared entanglement enables scaling beyond monolithic architectures. Hyperbolic Floquet codes use only weight-2 measurements and are good candidates for distributed quantum error correcting codes. We construct hyperbolic and semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes from $\{8,3\}$, $\{10,3\}$, and $\{12,3\}$ tessellations via the Wythoff kaleidoscopic construction with the Low-Index Normal Subgroups (LINS) algorithm and distribute them ...

### 🍮 [Subluminal and superluminal velocities of free-space photons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17576v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-19T17:35:59Z 🌀

> We consider rectilinear free-space propagation of electromagnetic wavepackets using electromagnetic field theory, scalar wavepacket propagation, and quantum-mechanical formalism. We demonstrate that spatially localized wavepackets are inherently characterized by a subluminal group velocity and a superluminal phase velocity, whose product equals $c^2$. These velocities are also known as the 'energy' and 'momentum' velocities, introduced by K. Milton and J. Schwinger. We illustrate general conclus...
