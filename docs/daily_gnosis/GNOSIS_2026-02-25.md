### 🍮 [Is a covariant virtual tachyon viable?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20474v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-24T02:07:14Z 🌀

> Sidney Coleman has noted that superluminal particles or observers would be able to go back in time and have no definite trajectory according to subluminal observers, while not violating Lorentz invariance [1]. Recently, Dragan and Ekert have significantly developed similar ideas even further, which lead to formulation of ``quantum principle of relativity'' that intimately links the two theories [2]. However, field theory descriptions of an on-shell tachyon, described by scalar field $φ$ with neg...

### 🍮 [The quantum superluminality in the tunnel-ionization process of H-like atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20106v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-23T18:25:32Z 🌀

> The quantum tunneling time remains the subject of heated debate,
  and one of its most curious features is faster-than-light or
  superluminal tunneling.
  Our tunnel-ionization model of the time-delay, presented in previous work, shows good agreement with the attoclock measurement in the adiabatic and nonadiabatic field calibrations, which also enables the determination of the barrier time-delay.
  In the present work, we show that the tunnel-ionization for H-like atoms with large nuclear charg...

### 🍮 [A Quantum Internet Protocol Suite Beyond Layering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19998v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-23T16:03:30Z 🌀

> Layering, the protocol organization principle underpinning the classical Internet, is ill-suited to the Quantum Internet, built around entanglement, which is non-local and stateful. This paper proposes a quantum-native organizational principle based on dynamic composition, which replaces static layering with a distributed orchestration fabric driven by the node local state and in-band control. Each node runs a Dynamic Kernel that i) constructs a local PoA of candidate steps to advance a service ...

### 🍮 [GAP Measures and Wave Function Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19993v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-23T16:00:49Z 🌀

> GAP measures (also known as Scrooge measures) are a natural class of probability distributions on the unit sphere of a Hilbert space that come up in quantum statistical mechanics; for each density matrix $ρ$ there is a unique measure GAP$_ρ$. We describe and prove a property of these measures that was not recognized so far: If a wave function $Ψ$ is GAP$_ρ$ distributed and a collapse occurs, then the collapsed wave function $Ψ'$ is again GAP distributed (relative to the appropriate $ρ'$). This f...
